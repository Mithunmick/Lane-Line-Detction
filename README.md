Lane Line Detection with Image Compression for ADAS
Course Project â€“ DTU, Course: 34240 Data Science, Compression and Image Communication
Spring 2024

Developed a lane detection system using Python, OpenCV, and JPEG compression techniques for autonomous driving applications.

Applied Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and quantization to compress road images, achieving 30.1% bit rate reduction while preserving lane line fidelity.

Used Canny edge detection, Gaussian smoothing, and Hough Transform to detect and overlay lane markings in both compressed and uncompressed images.

Evaluated performance using PSNR (40.24 dB) and entropy estimation, demonstrating reliable lane detection post-compression.

Tools & Concepts: Python, OpenCV, DCT, PSNR, Entropy, Hough Transform, Image Segmentation.
